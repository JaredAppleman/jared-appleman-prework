# jared-appleman-prework
assessments

This project is my work for the Dev10 Prework. It demonstrates my knowledge of html, css, and javascript.
The most important files are the module assessments because they were bigger projects where I had more freedom to show what I learned.
-Module-1 is a 3 page, sample website about myself
-Module-2 is a single page javascript game for Hangman.
You can view my work to judge my abilities or as an example for your own project.
I am the sole maintainer and contributer for this project. You can email me at jared.appleman13@yahoo.com for any help or questions.
